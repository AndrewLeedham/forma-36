In this package, there are two components (`DateTime` and `RelativeDateTime`) that will return a date following [Forma 36 guidelines](https://f36.contentful.com/guidelines/date-and-time/).

## DateTime

The DateTime component will format any date to a human friendly format and wrap it in a `<time>` tag.
It allows four different forms of display that can be controlled by changing the `format` prop:

| `format` option | Result                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| `full`          | 12 Aug 2020 at 8:00 AM |
| `day`           | 12 Aug 2020            |
| `time`          | 8:00 AM                |
| `weekday`       | Wed, 12 Aug            |

### Examples

```tsx static=true
import { DateTime } from '@contentful/f36-datetime';

<DateTime date="2021-08-17T15:45" />; // passing a Timestamp as an ISOString
<DateTime date={new Date()} />; // passing a JS Date
<DateTime date={1629240300000} />; // passing a Unix Epoch in milliseconds
```

All the usages above will result in 'Tue, 17 Aug 2021 at 3:45 PM'

## RelativeDateTime

Provides a relative date string for resolutions ranging from seconds up through years. Should be used when absolute date and time is unnecessarily specific.

### Examples

If we consider today as August 18th of 2021 and we use pass the following values to the Component

```tsx static=true
import { RelativeDateTime } from '@contentful/f36-datetime';

<RelativeDateTime date="2021-08-17T15:45" />; // passing a Timestamp as an ISOString
<RelativeDateTime date={new Date()} />; // passing a JS Date
<RelativeDateTime date={1629240300000} />; // passing a Unix Epoch in milliseconds
```

The component will display `a day ago`

### Passing a `baseDate`

Normally, the component compare your `date` with todayâ€™s date. But maybe you need to render a relative date
that is compared with some other day that is not today. You can do that by using `baseDate`:

```tsx static=true
import { RelativeDateTime } from '@contentful/f36-datetime';

<RelativeDateTime baseDate="2021-08-17T15:45" date="2021-08-18T15:45" />;
```

The component will display `in a day`

### Using `isRelativeToCurrentWeek`

Still using the last example. If you only need a relative date if the given date is within the current week,
that is possible by using the boolean `isRelativeToCurrentWeek`

```tsx static=true
import { RelativeDateTime } from '@contentful/f36-datetime';

<RelativeDateTime date="2021-08-17T15:45" isRelativeToCurrentWeek />; // It will display "Yesterday at 3:45 PM"

<RelativeDateTime date="2021-08-18T10:45" isRelativeToCurrentWeek />; // It will display "5 hours ago"

<RelativeDateTime date="2021-08-18T15:45" isRelativeToCurrentWeek />; // It will display "Tomorrow at 3:45 PM"
```
